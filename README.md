# Cross-site-request-forgery-CSRF-
Under Cisco CCNA Cybersecurity Operations performed a CSRF attack which is  is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
With a little help of social engineering, an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. 
If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. 
If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.
